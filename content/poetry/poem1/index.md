Chasing trees and outwardly  
Sensing a passing of clutter,  
You glimpse a frame of time  
Through this whirling globe.  
A fairground ride wouldn't be  
Unlike this spinning cycle -  
All heads turned together  
As if linked by some  
Unthought of singularity.  
  
The pausing of a face frozen  
With a smile;  
An arm outstretched,  
Tracing an arc through the night sky.  
Everything moves: motion is energy.
