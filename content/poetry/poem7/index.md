Cars and commuting induce  
Hatred of other prisoners  
Of mobile sealed-off  
Containers of death.  

We're all driven by a tendency  
To compete:  
Hey, I bet I can beat you,  
You, in the BMW.  

Driverholics out there,  
Spare a thought for the  
Synthetic nature of your situation:  
You add to a nation's sense of alienation.
