Fleeting glimpses of pale skies grey your eyes;  
Your motion carries merely still-frames,  
Snatched through intervals of vision.  

As you wander the cold gaps of dormant life,  
Your sense of belonging to the transition  
And its apathetic cycle draws you into seclusion.

When the bold colours hammer their signature,  
You are the moment's contrast in an opening scene,  
Soon to be captured by a riot of drama.  
The unfurled banner of natural influence  
Paves the way for a once forgotten substance  
Now tangible in its fertile potency.
