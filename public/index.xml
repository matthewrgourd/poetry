      <description>Chasing trees and outwardly
Sensing a passing of clutter,
You glimpse a frame of time
Through this whirling globe.
A fairground ride wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
Unlike this spinning cycle -
All heads turned together
As if linked by some
Unthought of singularity.
The pausing of a face frozen
With a smile;
An arm outstretched,
Tracing an arc through the night sky.
Everything moves: motion is energy.

      <description>I, the spindly-legged man, wonder wistfully whether
There&amp;rsquo;ll ever be a time of outward growth.
A thin man, me, to most I look like a spider â€“
I think myself to be more like a greyhound or
A stripped-down rally car.
All mind and muscle,
I have neither room for fat
Nor time to sit.

      <description>Fleeting glimpses of pale skies grey your eyes;
Your motion carries merely still-frames,
Snatched through intervals of vision.
As you wander the cold gaps of dormant life,
Your sense of belonging to the transition
And its apathetic cycle draws you into seclusion.
When the bold colours hammer their signature,
You are the moment&amp;rsquo;s contrast in an opening scene,
Soon to be captured by a riot of drama.
The unfurled banner of natural influence</description>

      <description>Staring star-faced into the black sky at night
You see the pure white pinpricks of light,
Far superior to Hollywood glitter.
It&amp;rsquo;s as if a rapid-fire gun in the sky has
Randomly holed the black sheet of the universe
To reveal a surprise.

      <description>A calamitous life,
Carry a knife,
Trouble and strife.
Old age will come without a gun
Though the fight for space is not without
Struggle.
Make more money; haggle; be abused by
Shopkeepers. Life is a Tupperware party:
All plastic and empty vacuums.

      <description>Wicked whiskey, like
Cocaine, creeps
Inside without knocking.
Slowly, you begin to
Feel its heat thread
Through you; feel its Insidious grip&amp;hellip;

      <description>Cars and commuting induce
Hatred of other prisoners
Of mobile sealed-off
Containers of death.
We&amp;rsquo;re all driven by a tendency
To compete:
Hey, I bet I can beat you,
You, in the BMW.
Driverholics out there,
Spare a thought for the
Synthetic nature of your situation:
You add to a nation&amp;rsquo;s sense of alienation.

      <description>Two plastic eggs
One stainless steel cutlery set (stained)
A pair of wicker chairs
Four candles
A collection of happy songs
Countless doubters
Some hardwired selfishness
One camera obscura
Several dark horses (guilt-ridden)
Bucketfuls of sobriety
A cauldron (one careful owner)
Some money (spent)
An old hat stand 32,850 days 4,680 weeks One life (lived)
